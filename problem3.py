# Problem 3: Domino
# Given list of dominos like [1|2] [3|1] [2|3]
# Compute a way to order a given set of dominoes in such a way that they form a correct domino chain
# (the dots on one half of a stone match the dots on the neighboring half of an adjacent stone) and
# that dots on the halves of the stones which don't have a neighbor (the first and last stone) match each other.

# Example:
# Input: [2|1], [2|3] and [1|3]
# Output: `[1|2] [2|3] [3|1]` or `[3|2] [2|1] [1|3]` or `[1|3] [3|2] [2|1]`
# etc, where the first and last numbers are the same.

# Input: [1|2], [4|1] and [2|3]
# Output: [4|1] [1|2] [2|3] first and last numbers are not the same.

# Assumption: I am given tuple
